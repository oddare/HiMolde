You are organizing a bowling activity for a group of students and have a restricted budget.  

To enter the place, the venue charges a price of 100 NOK for a group of up to 12 people, 
120 NOK for a group from 13 up to 50 people and 130 NOK for a group of more than 50 people. 
Besides, enough bowling lines must be rented for all the students to play simultaneously. 
Each bowling line is used simultaneously by up to 4 students. 
Any number of bowling lines can be rented for 200 NOK each.
Write a function that, given the budget and the number of participants in the activity, 
returns True if the budget is enough and False otherwise.
